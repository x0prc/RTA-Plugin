A plugin for Wireshark that provides Real-Time Alerting mechanism for suspicious activities or anomalies in traffic patterns.

# Motivation
While Wireshark provides detailed packet analysis, it does not have built-in alerting mechanisms for suspicious activities or anomalies in traffic patterns. This means users must manually monitor and analyze captured data without automated notifications. This repository automates the said process.
